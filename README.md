# READY TO BE DISCHARGED: EXAMINING HOSPITAL READMISSIONS

## Overview

This project aims to tackle the challenge of hospital readmissions through the lens of machine learning. By developing predictive models, we seek to forecast if and when a patient might be readmitted after being discharged. This initiative is not just a technical endeavor but a potentially transformative approach to enhancing patient care, optimizing hospital operations, and reducing healthcare costs.

### Objectives

The project is structured around two primary objectives:

- **Binary Classification**: To create a model capable of predicting whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge.
- **Multiclass Classification**: To develop a model that predicts the timeframe of a patient's readmission, categorized into “No readmission”, “Readmission in less than 30 days”, and “Readmission after 30 days”.

These models aim to provide actionable insights that healthcare providers can use to implement preventive measures and timely interventions.

### Introduction

Hospital readmissions are a critical metric for assessing the quality of care and a significant factor in rising healthcare expenses. Predictive modeling in this domain offers a promising avenue to identify potential readmissions before they occur, particularly for high-risk groups such as diabetic patients. This project endeavors to leverage machine learning to predict hospital readmissions, thereby facilitating improved patient outcomes and significant cost savings.

### Dataset Description

- **Patient Demographics**: Includes race, gender, age, weight, and insurance information.
- **Healthcare Utilization**: Details on outpatient, emergency, and inpatient visits in the year preceding the encounter.
- **Clinical Information**: Covers medical specialty, average pulse, lab test results, medication details, and diagnoses.

#### Target Variables:

- `readmitted_binary`: Indicates if a patient was readmitted within 30 days.
- `readmitted_multiclass`: Categorizes readmission timeframe as “<30 days”, “>30 days”, or “No readmission”.
